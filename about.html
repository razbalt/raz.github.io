<h2> About Raz </h2>
<p>	 	Hi, my name is Raz Baltazar (That is my real name if you’re wondering), and my life is different from most. I’m from a very unique small island in the Pacific Ocean called Guam. Guam, is a small U.S territory in the middle of the Pacific ocean near the Philippines, where my parents grew up. I grew up in a small town two hours south from the University of Maine, which is Bath, Maine. Bath will always have a special place in my heart because in my opinion it’s one of the kindest and most beautiful towns in Maine!
	I came to the Universe of Maine in hoping to Major in Finance or even MIS because I love how money grows and works. I'm not bad with software or computer hardware, but I'm very interested in Computer Science. If you want to contact me and a quick response, the best way to reach me is @ raz.baltazar@maine.edu
